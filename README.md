# ngrok-to-dotenv

This is a ngrok start-up wrapper that uses a dotenv file (at '../.env' relative to this project's folder) to get the authtoken and save the https address; it's a node cli tool that you can use with projects that need ngrok. You clone it into your project's folder, and add to the project's package.json a run script to call "cd ngrok-to-dotenv && node ngrok". Be sure to add the folder to your .gitignore and install the one package which is ngrok and command-line-args, using 'npm i' or 'yarn'. The 'node ngrok' script supports two arguments --proto or -p (string, example 'html'), --addr or -a (number, the port number).
